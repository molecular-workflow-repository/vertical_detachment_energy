description: Calculate the energy necessary to photoionize a closed-shell molecule.
methods: |
  This workflow calculates the "vertical detachment energy" (VDE) of a small molecule. The input
  molecule is first optimized at the RKS/B3LYP/6-31g level of theory. The VDE is
  is then calculated as the difference between the closed-shell singlet state (using
  RKS/B3LYP/6-31g) and the open shell doublet after removing an electron (using RKS/B3LYP/6-31g).
